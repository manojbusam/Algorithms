# Algorithms
1. Linked list
2. Searching : Binary - O(Log(N)) and Regular - O(N)
3. Sorting : Quick - O(N*Log(N)) and Selection - O(N^2)
4. Array rotation : GCD and Regular

 N represents length of list of numbers


Depth-For-Search

Time complexity : O(N^N +ElogE)

N is number of nodes
E is number of edges

Space Complexity: O(N + E)


Dikjstra : Shortest Path Algorithm in Graph

Time Complexity : O(N^2 + E)
Space Complexity : O(N + E)

N is number of nodes
E is number of edges
